# sai_week2_assaignment
This repository contains three Java assignments that demonstrate the use of constructors, method overloading, and user interaction dynamic inputs. Each class  as an example of fundamental Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and method overloading.

2. BankAccount Class
3. Rectangle Class

## Person Class 
The `Person` class represents a simple model of a person with attributes `name` and `age`. The class demonstrates the use of constructors to initialize object properties and a method to display the object's data.
The main method creates an instance of `Person` by accepting the name and age from the user.
The constructor initializes the `name` and `age` attributes.
The `display()` method outputs the person's details to the console.
  
 ## BankAccount Class
The `BankAccount` class models a simple bank account that supports depositing, withdrawing, and displaying the account balance. The class includes user interaction to perform these operations based on the user's choice. 
The constructor initializes the account with an account number, account holder's name, and an initial balance.
Methods `deposit()` and `withdrawal()` allow the user to modify the balance, while the `display()` method shows the current balance.
The `main` method presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between displaying the balance, depositing, or withdrawing funds, or exiting the program.

 ## Rectangle Class
The `Rectangle` class demonstrates method overloading by providing different ways to calculate the area of a rectangle. It supports both square and rectangular shapes and can also calculate the volume of a cuboid.
The constructor is overloaded to handle either a square (single side length) or a rectangle (length and width).
The `calculateArea()` method is overloaded to calculate the area of a rectangle or the volume of a cube when a height is provided.
The `displayDimensions()` method outputs the rectangle's dimensions.
The `main` method creates two rectangles (a square and a rectangle) and demonstrates area calculation for both, including volume calculation for a cube.
